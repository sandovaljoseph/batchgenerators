## Code standards

- Keep code comments concise (usually 1-2 lines)
- Avoid redundant or excessive inline commentary
- Use ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English, simple wordings

### Examples

```c++
  // Good (no comment)

  std::string module_name =
    fmt::format("{}_{:x}", name_, std::hash<std::string>{}(source_));

  // Bad (excessive comment for explicit code)

  // The module cache is keyed on this name, so it has to include the source:
  // two kernels sharing a name but not a body would otherwise both run
  // whichever was compiled first. Same fix as 3833 on the Metal side.
```
